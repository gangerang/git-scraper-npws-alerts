The operation will use 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) poison for the control of foxes. The program is designed to minimise fox impacts on wildlife, especially threatened species. Signs will be placed at the entry to the baiting area. Domestic pets are not permitted in NSW NPWS-managed lands. Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs) and should be restrained or muzzled in the vicinity and also must not enter the baiting location. In the event of accidental poisoning seek immediate veterinary assistance. Please contact the local Coffs Coast NPWS area office for more information on 02 6652 0900.</p>",

This program is designed to minimise predator impacts on wildlife, especially threatened species, and to minimise the impact of wild dogs on neighbouring stock.</p>\n\n<p>Baiting programs will take place across Kosciuszko National Park in Thredbo/Ingebyra, Dalgety/Paupong and Corrowong/Tombong/Merriangaah Wild Dog Plan Areas. Baiting programs will also be undertaken in Paupong, Merriangaah and Quidong Nature Reserves.</p>\n\n<p>This includes the following sections of Kosciuszko National Park: Thredbo Valley, Moonbah, Ingebyra, Paupong, Numbla Vale and Corrowong.</p>\n\n<p>Signs will be placed at the entry to the baiting location. Domestic pets are not permitted in NSW National Parks managed lands. Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs). Pets and working dogs must be restrained or muzzled in the vicinity and must not enter the baiting location. In the event of accidental poisoning seek immediate veterinary assistance.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>For further information, please call the Jindabyne area office on 02 6450 5555.</p>",

The operation will use 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) poison for the control of wild dogs and foxes.</p>\n\n<p>The program is designed to minimise predator impacts on wildlife, especially threatened species, and to minimise impact of wild dogs on neighbouring stock. Signs will be placed at the entry to the baiting location.</p>\n\n<p>Domestic pets are not permitted on NPWS estate. Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs). Pets and working dogs must be restrained or muzzled in the vicinity and must not enter the baiting location. In the event of accidental poisoning seek immediate veterinary assistance.</p>\n\n<p>For further information please contact the NPWS Barwon Area office on (02) 6792 7300.</p>",

This program is designed to minimise predator impacts on wildlife, especially threatened species, and to minimise the impact of wild dogs on neighbouring stock.</p>\n\n<p>Baiting programs will take place across Kosciuszko National Park in Thredbo/Ingebyra, Dalgety/Paupong and Corrowong/Tombong/Merriangaah Wild Dog Plan Areas. Baiting programs will also be undertaken in Paupong, Merriangaah and Quidong Nature Reserves.</p>\n\n<p>This includes the following sections of Kosciuszko National Park: Thredbo Valley, Moonbah, Ingebyra, Paupong, Numbla Vale and Corrowong.</p>\n\n<p>Signs will be placed at the entry to the baiting location. Domestic pets are not permitted in NSW National Parks managed lands. Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs). Pets and working dogs must be restrained or muzzled in the vicinity and must not enter the baiting location. In the event of accidental poisoning seek immediate veterinary assistance.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>For further information, please call the Jindabyne area office on 02 6450 5555.</p>",
