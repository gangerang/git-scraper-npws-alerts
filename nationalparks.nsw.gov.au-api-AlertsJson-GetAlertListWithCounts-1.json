These works are conducted in order to; control exotic grasses and environmental weeds, assist with grounds maintenance activities such&#xA0;as mowing and improve the aesthetics of the site. In addition, NPWS staff then treat&#xA0;other emerging weeds on a cases by case basis, such as St&#xA0;Johns Wort using Grazon Extra.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>For further information regarding this activity please contact the NPWS Central West Area office at either Dubbo on 02 6841 7100 or Bathurst on 02 6332 7640</p>",

Baiting programs will also be undertaken in Paupong, Merriangaah and Quidong Nature Reserves.</p>\n\n<p>This includes the following sections of Kosciuszko National Park: Thredbo Valley, Moonbah, Ingebyra, Paupong, Numbla Vale and Corrowong.</p>\n\n<p>Signs will be placed at the entry to the baiting location.
