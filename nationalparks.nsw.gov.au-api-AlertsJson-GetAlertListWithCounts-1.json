Domestic pets are not permitted in NSW National Parks managed lands. Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs).

Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs)&#x202F;and should be restrained or muzzled in the vicinity and also must not enter the baiting location.

Australian wildlife has a naturally high tolerance to 1080 and will not be negatively impacted.</p>\n\n<p>The program is designed to minimise the impact of feral pigs, wild dogs and foxes&#xA0;on native vegetation, wildlife and neighbouring enterprises.</p>\n\n<p>Signs will be placed at the entry to the baiting location. Domestic pets are not permitted in NSW National Parks managed lands. Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs). Pets and working dogs must be restrained or muzzled in the vicinity and must not enter the baiting location. In the event of accidental poisoning seek immediate veterinary assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Please contact the local Barwon NPWS area office for more information on 6792 7300.</p>",
