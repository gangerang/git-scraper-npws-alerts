Domestic pets are not permitted in NSW National Parks and most other NPWS managed land. Pets and working dogs may be affected (1080 is lethal to cats and dogs). Pets and working dogs must be restrained or muzzled in the vicinity and must not enter the baiting location. In the event of accidental poisoning seek immediate veterinary assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Please contact NPWS Gloucester Office on 02 6538 5300 or Scone Office on 02 6540 2300 for more information.</p>",
